# `use` Hook (React 18+)

The `use` hook is a new React Hook introduced in React 18 that allows you to read the value of a resource like a Promise or Context directly within a component's render logic. It's designed to simplify data fetching and context consumption in Suspense-enabled environments.

### When to use it
-   To read the resolved value of a Promise directly within a component.
-   To read the value of a Context without using `useContext` (though `useContext` is still valid).
-   When working with Suspense for data fetching.

### Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `use` hook to read the resolved value of a Promise.

```tsx
'use client';

import { useState, Suspense } from 'react';

// Simulate an async data fetch
function fetchData(): Promise<string> {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('Data fetched successfully!');
    }, 2000);
  });
}

// A component that uses the `use` hook to read a Promise
function DataDisplay() {
  // The `use` hook will suspend the component until the Promise resolves
  const data = use(fetchData());
  return <p>{data}</p>;
}

export default function UseHookExample() {
  const [showData, setShowData] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setShowData(true)}>
        Load Data
      </button>
      {showData && (
        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading data...</div>}>
          <DataDisplay />
        </Suspense>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Key Points
-   The `use` hook can only be called inside a component or another Hook.
-   When `use` is called with a Promise, the component will suspend until the Promise resolves. This requires a `<Suspense>` boundary above the component.
-   It provides a more direct way to handle asynchronous data compared to `useEffect` for data fetching.
-   It can also be used to read Context values: `const value = use(MyContext);`
